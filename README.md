# Optimizations
TThere are still a few things left to integrate. I still have a lot of design choices ahead of me, such as the mobile responsiveness of the site among many other changes.

>  Validation and filtering: Verifying that the incoming data conforms to the expected format and meets certain criteria. This can involve checking data types, length limits, or specific patterns. For instance, ensuring that an email address follows a valid format or that a numeric value is within an acceptable range.

>  Sanitize the data: To sanitize incoming data means to clean and validate the data before processing or storing it in a system. The process of sanitizing data aims to prevent or mitigate potential security risks, such as injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), or other forms of malicious activities that exploit vulnerabilities in the system.

> Increase the scope of plants as well as a means to where to obtain them 

> Framework: Migrate from spline to webpack to vite.
